# Compiling and Running using Terminal
---
1. Open the terminal inside **IntelliJ**. Refer to image bellow
2. `cd src`
3. `javac com/amigoscode/Main.java` - This creates a file called `Main.class`
4. `java com.amigoscode.Main`

You should see `Hello World` on the terminal

![Screenshot 2021-08-17 at 18 09 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40702606/129770619-f9dc04a8-72ce-402a-bfd2-dda2df8ee414.png)

> Notice Main.class

# Byte Code
Bytecodes are the machine language of the Java virtual machine. There are other so called JVM languages such: 
1. Java 
2. Groovy
3. Scala
4. Kotlin
5. Closure

This means that we just need to have JDK installed and we can write code in any other above languages.

This Java code needs to be compiled into bytecode for the JVM to run it.
```java
package com.amigoscode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // write your code here
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Inside **IntelliJ**
Select the file called `Main` under `GettingStarted/out/production/GettingStarted/com/amigoscode`

The above code is what is fed to to the JVM to run our program.

# Java Reserved Keywords
Java has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variables, methods, classes, or any other identifiers:

Taken from https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_keywords.asp  

|Keyword	| Description|
|-----------| -----------
abstract | A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)
assert | For debugging
boolean | A data type that can only store true and false values
break | Breaks out of a loop or a switch block
byte | A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 and 127
case | Marks a block of code in switch statements
catch | Catches exceptions generated by try statements
char | A data type that is used to store a single character
class | Defines a class
continue | Continues to the next iteration of a loop
const | Defines a constant. Not in use - use final instead
default | Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
do | Used together with while to create a do-while loop
double | A data type that can store whole numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+308
else | Used in conditional statements
enum | Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type
exports | Exports a package with a module. New in Java 9
extends | Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class)
final | A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override)
finally | Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not
float | A data type that can store whole numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038
for | Create a for loop
goto | Not in use, and has no function
if | Makes a conditional statement
implements | Implements an interface
import | Used to import a package, class or interface
instanceof | Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface
int | A data type that can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647
interface | Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods
long | A data type that can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775808
module | Declares a module. New in Java 9
native | Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file (but in another language)
new | Creates new objects
package | Declares a package
private | An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class
protected | An access modifier used for attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses
public | An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class
requires | Specifies required libraries inside a module. New in Java 9
return | Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method

strictfp | Restrict the precision and rounding of floating point calculations
super | Refers to superclass (parent) objects
switch | Selects one of many code blocks to be executed
synchronized | A non-access modifier, which specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
this | Refers to the current object in a method or constructor
throw | Creates a custom error
throws | Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method
transient | A non-accesss modifier, which specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state
try | Creates a try...catch statement
var | Declares a variable. New in Java 10
void | Specifies that a method should not have a return value
volatile | Indicates that an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
while | Creates a while loop

# Comments
---
Comments are used to documment code or temporarily stop exuction of line or multile lines of code.

There single and multi line comments.

# Single comments
---
Single comments start with `//` and can be seen in the following code as ```// write your code here``` 
```java
package com.amigoscode;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // write your code here
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

Add a single line comment to ```System.out.println("Hello World");``` then run the application and see what the outout will be.    

# Multiline comments
Multiline comments start with `/*` and end with `*/` any code or text inside opening `/*` and the closing of `*/` will be treated as a comment therefore the code will will not run 
```java
package com.amigoscode;

public class Main {
    /*
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // write your code here
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
    */
}
```

# Variables
Variables are placehoders allowing you to store **primitives** and **reference types**. Each variable has an associated data type. 

For example if you store a number 
```java
int number = 20;
```

If you want to store a sequence of characters
```java
String firstName = "Mariam";
```

If you want to store some coordinates you can you for example
```java
Point p = new Point(20, 10);
```

# Primitives
Primitive types are used to store simple values. For example, whole numbers, decimal and characters. Here are the available data types for primitives.

- boolean
- byte
- short
- char
- int
- long
- float
- double

The difference between them is the type of value can be stored and the amount of memory required.

| Type    | Size (bits) | Minimum              | Maximum             | Example                       |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| byte    | 8           | -128                 | 127                 | byte b = 100;                 |
| short   | 16          | -32,768              | 32,767              | short s = 30_000;             |
| int     | 32          | -2147483648          | 2147483647          | int i = 100_000_000;          |
| long    | 64          | -9223372036854775808 | 9223372036854775807 | long l = 100_000_000_000_000; |
| float   | 32          | -2-149               | (2-2-23)·2127       | float f = 1.456f;             |
| double  | 64          | -2-1074              | (2-2-52)·21023      | double f = 1.456789012345678; |
| char    | 16          | 0                    | 216– 1              | char c = ‘c';                 |
| boolean | 1           |                      |                     | boolean b = true;             |

# Arithemtic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

| Operator | Name           | Description                            | Example |
|----------|----------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| +        | Addition       | Adds together two values               | x + y   |
| -        | Subtraction    | Subtracts one value from another       | x - y   |
| *        | Multiplication | Multiplies two values                  | x * y   |
| /        | Division       | Divides one value by another           | x / y   |
| %        | Modulus        | Returns the division remainder         | x % y   |
| ++       | Increment      | Increases the value of a variable by 1 | ++x     |
| --       | Decrement      | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 | --x     |

# Reference Types
Reference Types are used to strore complex types. i.e Objects. For example store details about a person.
```java
Person john = new Person("John", 22, Gender.MALE);
```

more on Reference types later.

# Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values using any datatype in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

Instead of
```java
String nameOne = "Ali";
String nameTwo = "Adam";
```

```java
String[] names = new String[2];
names[0] = "Ali";
names[2] = "Adam";
```

or slightly better

```java
String[] names = {"Ali", "Adam"};
```

Arrays size are fixed. Once you the array the size cannot be extended. In the above `names` arrays if we want to add third item we can't.

```java
names[2] = "Mike";
```

The above code will throw

```java
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 2 out of bounds for length 2
	at com.amigoscode.Main.main(Main.java:7)
```

Each item in the array are called element. The first element starts at index 0 even though the size is `2`.

```java
System.out.println(names.length); // 2
```

So: 
- size = `2`
-  `"Ali"` index is `0`
-  `"Adam" index is 1`.

You can override the value inside each element as such:

```java
names[0] = "Jamal"
```

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Arrays.html

# Strings
---
Strings allows you store sequence of characters.

```java
String brand = new String("Amigoscode")
```
or

```java
String brand = "Amigoscode"
```

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/d6JZehe5QJGBzlUjgi/giphy.gif)

Ok let me explain. Strings in Java are special in Java. Because they are used to often, the JVM sets aside a special area of memory for Strings.

Strings are immutable in Java. Immutable  means unmodifiable or unchangeable. When a String is created using **String literal**:

```java
String brand = "Amigoscode";
```

The the value `Amigoscode` is stored in a special area in the memory called `String constant pool`

Now lets create another variable using **String Object**. Not the `new` keyword. It creates a new Object.

```java
String youtubeChannelName = new String("Amigoscode");
```

Since `Amigoscode` is already present inside the String Pool `youtubeChannelName` refers to `Amigoscode`

Now both `brand` and `youtubeChannelName` refer to `Amigoscode`

![Screenshot 2021-08-18 at 11 46 55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40702606/129885239-1bf52ba7-0af1-4800-b598-58e15d2d5a51.png)

The reason Strings are immutable is because image if there are other variables referring to `Amigoscode` and the value changes, i.e `Amigoscode` to `Friendscode`. This can be problematic since all other variables would have a different value due to this side effect causing all sorts of unexpected behavior. To prevent this, Strings are immutable. 

**What about**
```java
String brand = new String("Amigoscode");
```

The difference is that when we create a String object using the new keyword, it always creates a new object in heap memory. And as we just saw, if we create an object using `String youtubeChannelName = "Amigoscode";`, it may return an existing object from the String pool, if it already exists. Otherwise, it will create a new String object inside the String Pool

# String equality
- `==` returns true if and only if both variables refer to the same object  
- `.equals()` returns true the "value" inside String is the same   
  
For this example `==` returns **true** because both `brand` and `youtubeChannelName` refer to the same object inside the **String Pool**.

```java
String brand = "Amigoscode";
String youtubeChannelName = "Amigoscode";
System.out.println(brand == youtubeChannelName); // True
System.out.println(brand.equals(youtubeChannelName)); // True
```
For this example `==` returns **false** because both `brand` and `youtubeChannelName` refer to different objects inside the **Heap**.

```java
String brand = new String("Amigoscode");
String youtubeChannelName = new String("Amigoscode");
System.out.println(brand == youtubeChannelName); // False
System.out.println(brand.equals(youtubeChannelName)); // True
```

# ++ and -- Operators
++ and -- operator are used to inline increment or decrement a value   

Consider
```java
int i = 0;
```


- i++ Returns the value and increments
```java
int i = 0;
System.out.println(i++); // 0
System.out.println(i); // 1
```

- ++i Increments and returns the value 
```java
int i = 0;
System.out.println(++i); // 1
System.out.println(i); // 1
```

- i-- Returns the value and decrements
```java
int i = 0;
System.out.println(i--); // 0
System.out.println(i); // -1
```

- --i Decrements the value and increments
```java
int i = 0;
System.out.println(i--); // -1
System.out.println(i); // -1
```

# Loops
In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, your want to print all numbers of 0 to 10, then rather than typing the same code 10 times, you can use a loop.

In Java there many types of loops.

> Fori loop

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
/*
Output:
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
*/
```

```for``` is the construct. Then inside `()` we have: 
- `int i = 1;` This is the initial expression
- `i<=10;` This logical operator indicates when to stop the loop. If false keep looping else stop.
- `i++` updates the value of initial expression.


# Looping through arrays
```java
String[] names = {"Jamila", "Mark"};
```

```java
for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(names[i]);
}
```

The above syntax is a little bit confusing. So we can use the **enhanced for loop**

```java
for (String name : names) {
    System.out.println(name);
}
```

In Java there are other types of Loops that we will explore later

# Beak, Continue and Return keywords
## Break
The break statement is used to jump out of a loop or statement
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}
/* 
Output:
    0
    1
    2
    3
*/
```

## Continue
The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i <= 4) {
    continue;
  }
  System.out.println(i);
}
/* 
Output:
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
*/
```

## Return
The return statement can be used to end function execution or return values.

```java
public int getNumber() {
    return 1;
}
```

```java
public void terminateEarly(boolean exit) {
    System.out.println("I run :)");
    if (exit) {
        return;
    }
    System.out.println("I don't run :(");
}
```

# Packages
A package is simply a folder that groups related types (Java classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations).

Java ships with pre existing packages and classes that we can take advantage of. For example if we want to accept user input from the terminal/cmd we can user the Scanner class.

To use the scanner class we need to import the class or the entire package. This has to be done right after `package com.amigoscode;` as follow

```java
package com.amigoscode;

import java.util.Scanner;
```

The above code import Scanner class and we can use it as follows.

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

or we can import the entire package. Avoid this method since it is harder to know which classes you are using from the package.

```java
package com.amigoscode;

import java.util.*;
```

Here is an example with multiple imports

```java
package com.amigoscode;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Scanner;
```

You are not just limited to import existing packages and classes. You can import your own as follows

1. Right click on `com.amigoscode`, the create package and name it model for example

![Screenshot 2021-08-19 at 11 22 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40702606/130054122-3bcdedbd-ddb8-48bd-a48e-d829f3d11a0e.png)


2. Create a class called Person inside `com.amigoscode.model` package

![Screenshot 2021-08-19 at 11 31 37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40702606/130054110-e70da956-6a92-4f30-89e3-bc310c83ad73.png)

![Screenshot 2021-08-19 at 11 30 50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40702606/130054118-462927e3-1f11-442f-ab33-6087cfc2fa3d.png)

3. Inside the class Main, have a look at the import statement.  

```java
package com.amigoscode;

import com.amigoscode.model.Person;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Person person = new Person();
    }
}
```

# Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values and return `true` or `false`

| Operator                 | Sign | Example |
|--------------------------|------|---------|
| Equal to                 | ==   | a==b    |
| Not equal to             | !=   | a!=b    |
| Less than                | <    | a<b     |
| Greater than             | >    | a>b     |
| Less than or equal to    | <=   | a<=b    |
| Greater than or equal to | >=   | a>=b    |

# Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine 2 more or more comparison operators

| Operator | Sign | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| And      | &&   | a==b    |
| Or       | \|\| | a!=b    |

#  Conditions and If Statements
If statements allows you decide weather to execute code based on the result of boolean expressions. Any code which returns true or false can be used with if statements.

Java has the following conditional statements:
- if
- else
- else if
- switch

`if`
```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

```java
if (1 > 0) {
  System.out.println("1 is greater than 0");
}
```

`else`
```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

`else if`
```java
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if above condition is false
} else if (condition3) {
  // block of code to be executed if above all conditions are false
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if above all conditions are false
}
```

# Switch
The `switch` statement allow you to replace multiple nested if else statements.   
The `break` keyword is used to terminate a statement. The break statement is optional. If omitted, execution will continue on into the next case.

```java
int day = 4;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");

# Reading User Input with Scanner class

Note the import statement

```java
package com.amigoscode;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter username");

        String userName = scanner.nextLine();  // Read user input
        System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);
    }
}
```

`nextLine()` reads Strings input. There are other methods available for different data types.
